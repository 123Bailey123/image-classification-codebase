# Image Classification Codebase

This project **aims** to provide a codebase for the image classification task implemented by PyTorch.
It does not use any high-level deep learning libraries (such as pytorch-lightening or MMClassification).
Thus, it should be easy to follow and modified.
Note that this project **does not aim** to offer any pretrained models.

## Get Started

### Requirements

 - Python 3.7+
 - PyTorch 1.4+
 - Torchvision
 - DALI 0.28+ (Optional)

### Basic Usage

### Train with Custom Model

### Train with Custom Dataset


## Features

 - Distributed training support (Use native Pytorch API).
 - DALI data processing support.

## Roadmap
  
  - AMP support.
  - Auto checkpoint support.
  - Other tricks.
